Global labels are unique names, which can be referenced multiple times, but only defined once. Local labels are non-unique names. They can be referenced multiple times, and any reference indicates if they refer to a label after the reference, or a label before the reference. A static label records how many local labels with the same name have been emitted beforehand so we can treat them as local labels as well."]]};
