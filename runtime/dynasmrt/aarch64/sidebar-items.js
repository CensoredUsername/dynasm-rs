Instead of writing to a temporary assembling buffer, this struct assembles directly into an executable buffer. The `goto` method can be used to set the assembling offset in the `ExecutableBuffer` of the assembler (this offset is initialized to 0) after which the data at this location can be overwritten by assembling into this struct."]]});
