initSidebarItems({"struct":[["Assembler","This struct is an implementation of a dynasm runtime. It supports incremental compilation as well as multithreaded execution with simultaneous compilation. Its implementation ensures that no memory is writeable and executable at the same time."],["AssemblyModifier","This struct is a wrapper around an `Assembler` normally created using the `Assembler.alter` method. Instead of writing to a temporary assembling buffer, this struct assembles directly into an executable buffer. The `goto` method can be used to set the assembling offset in the `ExecutableBuffer` of the assembler (this offset is initialized to 0) after which the data at this location can be overwritten by assembling into this struct."],["UncommittedModifier","This struct is a wrapper around an `Assembler` normally created using the `Assembler.alter_uncommitted` method. It allows the user to edit parts of the assembling buffer that cannot be determined easily or efficiently in advance. Due to limitations of the label resolution algorithms, this assembler does not allow labels to be used."]]});
